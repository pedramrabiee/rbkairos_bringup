# Gripper Controllers Configuration for RB-Kairos+
# Author: Pedram Rabiee (prabiee@3laws.io)
#
# This file configures the gripper controller for Gazebo Ignition simulation.
# The joint name includes the namespace prefix (rbkairos_gripper_).
# Note: Controller type is defined in robotnik_description/simulators/gazebo_ignition/rbkairos/rbkairos_controller_params.yaml
